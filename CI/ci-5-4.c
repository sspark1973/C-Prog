5 4 Explain what the following code does: ((n & (n-1)) == 0) 
*/

SOLUTION
We can work backwards to solve this question   

What does it mean if A & B == 0? 
It means that A and B never have a 1 bit in the same place   

So if n & (n-1) == 0, then n and n-1 never share a 1 
What does n-1 look like (as compared with n)? 

Try doing subtraction by hand (in base 2 or 10)   What happens?
  1101011000 [base 2] - 1 = 1101010111 [base 2]
  593100 [base 10] - 1 = 593099 [base 10] 

 When you subtract 1 from a number, 
 you look at the least significant bit.   

 If it's a 1 
 you change it to zero and you are done   

 If it¡¯s a zero, 
 you must ¡°borrow¡± from a larger bit   

 So, you go to increasingly larger bits, 
 changing each bit from a 0 to a 1, until you find a 1   

 You flip that one to a 0 and you are done   

 Thus, n-1 will look like n, 
 except that n¡¯s initial 0s will be 1¡¯s in n-1, 
 and n¡¯s least significant 1 will be a 0 in (n-1)   
 That is: 
 if     n = abcde1000 
 then n-1 = abcde0111 

 So what does n & (n-1) == 0 indicate? 

 n and (n-1) must have no 1s in common   

 Given that they look like this: 
 if     n = abcde1000 
 then n-1 = abcde0111 
 abcde must be all 0s, 
 which means that n must look like this: 00001000   
 n is therefore a power of two 
 
 So, we have our answer: ((n & (n-1)) == 0) 
 checks if n is a power of 2 (or 0) 

in mathematics, 
a power of two means a number of the form 2^n 
where n is an integer, i.e.
